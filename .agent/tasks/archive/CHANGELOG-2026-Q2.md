### 2026-04-30

| Item | What |
|------|------|
| **v2.103.1** | `refactor(dashboard)`: banner polish + reintegrate splash inside main tea.Program. Solid horizontal rule replaces tick separator. 3-space inner gutter matches AUTOPILOT/QUEUE/HISTORY. Drop duplicate "PILOT" inside the frame; banner now leads with the version. Strip `claude-`/`gpt-` vendor prefixes from model IDs (`OPUS-4-7 / SONNET-4-6`). Smart adapter chip overflow: pack DAEMON + active adapters first, then inactives until full, then `+N idle` summary. Splash now folded into the main dashboard model — no alt-screen flicker, no init-log scroll between splash and dashboard. `--no-splash` flag removed. Released directly from `fix/dashboard-avionics-wiring` (PR #2459). |
| **v2.103.0** | `feat(dashboard)`: avionics-style TUI redesign — splash boot screen with animated lamps, 3-line bordered banner with version/env/model stack/adapter status dots/uptime/UTC clock, autopilot panel rework with STATE/PR/AGE block, CI/MERGE/RETRY mini-gauges, and 5-node pipeline rail (GH-2454 epic, GH-2455 sub-issue, PR #2456). Initial release shipped with three wiring gaps (logo persisted in steady state, banner state never populated, terminal pipeline stage missing marker) — fixed in v2.103.1 follow-up. |
| **Design pattern** | Pipeline rail switched from connector-based marker to lamp-per-node (`✓` done / `●` current / `○` pending). Connector approach left terminal stages with no current marker because there's no trailing connector; lamp-per-node always shows position. |
| **Banner adapter semantics** | `●` filled = configured AND CLI flag passed this run; `○` empty = configured but no flag; hidden = not in `cfg.Adapters`. Implemented via cobra `cmd.Flags().Lookup(name).Changed` check in `applyDashboardBannerMeta`. |
| **Splash UX gotcha** | First splash implementation used a separate `tea.Program` that ran before the dashboard's program. Caused alt-screen flicker: splash shows → exits alt screen → init logs scroll in normal terminal → dashboard re-enters alt screen. Fix: fold splash into the dashboard model itself with `EnableSplash()` + `splashFrame` + a `splashTickMsg` ticker; single program lifecycle, single alt-screen. |

### 2026-04-26 to 04-27

| Item | What |
|------|------|
| **v2.100.4** | `fix(ci)`: docs deploy chained-trigger fix — `docs-version-sync.yml` resolves token via PAT-or-GITHUB_TOKEN; `sync-docs.yml` adds `workflow_dispatch` (GH-2423, PR #2424). Wires future releases to auto-deploy `pilot.quantflow.studio` end-to-end without manual nudge. |
| **v2.100.3** | `fix(executor)`: send OpenCode `model` as `{providerID, modelID}` object — re-do of closed external PR #2408. Modern OpenCode (≥1.4.x) requires this; pre-fix Pilot couldn't send any message at all (GH-2407, GH-2413, PR #2414). |
| **v2.100.2** | `fix(executor)`: OpenCode response parsing — decodes `{info, parts}` shape from `POST /session/:id/message`, surfaces text parts as `Output`, tool/step parts as BackendEvents (GH-2409). Without this, even after schema fix, runs reported success with empty Output → silent failure downstream. |
| **Pipeline gotcha closed** | "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests" — root caused to **org-level** setting (qf-studio org), not repo-level. Org-level toggle blocked all repo-level overrides. Memory updated. |
| **Chained-trigger pattern** | `peter-evans/create-pull-request` + `gh pr merge --auto` using `GITHUB_TOKEN` does NOT trigger downstream `push`-event workflows (well-known limitation). Fix: pass a PAT (`PILOT_DOCS_PAT`) instead. PAT secret created with fine-grained scope: `Contents: r/w`, `Pull requests: r/w` for ylcn91/pilot only. Annual rotation reminder needed. |
| **Ghost-close pattern recurrence** | PR #2414 and #2424 both got `pilot-done` label set on parent issue while PR remained OPEN with green CI. Autopilot eventually merged both, but the desync makes status reporting unreliable. Logged for follow-up but no fix queued. |
| **Bench / TASK-26** | No movement — feat/aws-bench branch parked; main branch active for production work. |

### 2026-04-18

| Item | What |
|------|------|
| **v2.99.1** | `fix(executor)`: self-review `--resume` fallback mirrors Qwen logic + `sanitizeFilename` strips path separators (GH-2377, PR #2378) |
| **v2.99.0** | `refactor(autopilot)`: remove dead `prod-X.Y.Z` tag auto-push — `sync-docs.yml` already handles GitLab deploy (GH-2374, PR #2375 reverts #2370) |
| **v2.98.1 / v2.98.0** | Executor env injection of `api_base_url`/`default_model`/`api_auth_token` into Claude Code subprocess (GH-2287/GH-2371); `default_branch` honored (GH-2286); conventional-commit rewrite suggestion after 2nd reject; docs version sync unblocked manually via [PR #2373](https://github.com/ylcn91/pilot/pull/2373) (GitHub Actions lacks PR-create permission at repo level) |
| **Jira search migration** | GH-2289 deprecated `/rest/api/2|3/search` → `/rest/api/3/search/jql` (PR #2376, ghost-abandoned on first retry then recovered via escape-hatch dispatch) |
| **Known gotcha** | `docs-version-sync.yml` can't auto-PR after release — `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks PR-create permission (repo Settings toggle required) |
| **Reverted premise** | [PR #2370](https://github.com/ylcn91/pilot/pull/2370) shipped on a wrong assumption: `prod-X.Y.Z` GitHub tags trigger nothing — deploy lives in `sync-docs.yml`'s tag-push to GitLab. v2.99.0 reverts. |
