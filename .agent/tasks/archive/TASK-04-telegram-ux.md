# TASK-04: Telegram UX Improvements

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Created**: 2026-01-26
**Completed**: 2026-01-26
**Assignee**: Pilot (self-improvement)

---

## Context

**Problem**:
Current Telegram bot executes ALL messages as code tasks, including:
- Greetings ("Hi there") → 43s wasted execution
- Questions ("What is our next issue?") → Should answer, not execute
- Internal signals leak to user (`EXIT_SIGNAL: true`, `LOOP COMPLETE`)
- No confirmation before potentially destructive tasks
- No result details shown (just "Duration: 20s")

**Goal**:
Make Telegram bot intelligent - detect intent, confirm tasks, show clean output.

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Greetings/casual messages get friendly response (no execution)
- [x] Questions answered via Claude (read-only, no code changes)
- [x] Tasks confirmed before execution (with cancel option)
- [x] Clean output without internal signals
- [x] Result shows what was actually created/changed

---

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Intent Detection ✅
- `intent.go`: `DetectIntent()` classifies messages into:
  - `greeting` - hi, hello, hey, etc.
  - `question` - what is, how do, where is, ends with ?
  - `task` - create, add, fix, update, etc.
  - `command` - /help, /status, /cancel
- Pattern matching with regex for task references (TASK-xx, #123, etc.)
- Tests: 32 cases covering all intent types

### Phase 2: Response Handlers ✅
- `handleGreeting()` - Friendly response with username
- `handleQuestion()` - Read-only Claude prompt, answers about codebase
- `handleTask()` - Confirmation flow before execution
- `handleCommand()` - /help, /status, /cancel support

### Phase 3: Confirmation Flow ✅
- Inline keyboard: [✅ Execute] [❌ Cancel]
- Pending task storage with 5-minute expiry
- Callback query handling for button clicks
- Text fallback: "yes/no" replies also work

### Phase 4: Clean Output ✅
- `formatter.go`: Strips internal signals
  - EXIT_SIGNAL, LOOP COMPLETE, NAVIGATOR_STATUS blocks
  - Phase:, Progress:, Iteration: lines
- Extracts file changes (created/modified/added/deleted)
- Shows commit SHA (short) and PR link when available
