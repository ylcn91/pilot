// when the row has no error (mirrors the HasCompletedExecution SQL which excludes error!=”
// rows unconditionally, preventing the two sites from diverging on the {pr_url, error} case).
// CommitSHA alone is accepted for backwards-compat (direct-commit workflows) but
// logs a warning because it can be a parent SHA if the ghost-SHA guard was bypassed.
// Epic-parent rows (status=completed, no deliverable) correctly return false.
